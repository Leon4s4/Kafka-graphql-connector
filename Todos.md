## Production Readiness Status

### ‚úÖ Resolved Critical Issues

- **Security**: Headers now use Password type for secure credential handling
- **Offset Management**: Proper commit() and commitRecord() methods implemented for at-least-once delivery
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with circuit breaker pattern
- **Resource Management**: Robust HTTP client cleanup with graceful shutdown
- **JMX Monitoring**: Full metrics and health monitoring implementation
- **Circuit Breaker**: Complete circuit breaker pattern with automatic recovery
- **Deployment**: Comprehensive Docker setup and configuration examples

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed

- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive integration test suite with Docker Compose setup
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Full GitHub Actions workflow with automated testing and releases

### ‚ùå Remaining Items for Production

- **Performance Benchmarks**: No performance testing framework implemented

### üîÑ Recommendations for Production Enhancement

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Benchmark suite for throughput and latency testing
   - Memory usage profiling under load
   - Connection pool optimization metrics

The connector is **production-ready** for most use cases with comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and security features implemented.
