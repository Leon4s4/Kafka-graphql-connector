Critical Issues

  Security: Headers configuration parsing in
  GraphQLSourceConnectorConfig.java:58-71 is
  vulnerable to malicious input and doesn't
  handle secrets properly.

  Offset Management: Missing transaction
  support could lead to data loss or
  duplication during failures
  (GraphQLSourceTask.java:94-105).

  Error Handling: Runtime exceptions in poll()
  method (GraphQLSourceTask.java:148) will
  crash the connector instead of graceful
  failure handling.

  Resource Management: HTTP client cleanup in
  stop() method
  (GraphQLSourceTask.java:372-385) doesn't
  guarantee proper resource disposal.

  Missing Production Features

  - No metrics/JMX monitoring
  - No schema validation for GraphQL responses

  - No circuit breaker for failed endpoints
  - Limited test coverage (only unit tests, no
  integration tests)
  - No performance benchmarks
  - Missing deployment configuration examples

  Recommendations for Production

  1. Implement proper secret management for
  authentication
  2. Add comprehensive integration tests with
  real GraphQL endpoints
  3. Implement metrics and health checks
  4. Add schema validation and type safety
  5. Enhance error handling with circuit
  breakers
  6. Add performance monitoring and alerting
  7. Create proper deployment documentation

  The code shows good practices in logging,
  configuration, and basic error handling, but
  needs significant hardening for production
  workloads.
